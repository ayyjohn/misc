## SUDOKU

A simple sudoku solver that uses a bruteforce algorithm to present just one solution to the grid.

Input:
The program ignores excessive whitespace, so use it just for seperating the integers.
Enter 0 ( zero ) to represent an empty space.
Only 9x9 grids are accepted.

Output:
The program will output a 9x9 grid that is the solution of the puzzle.
